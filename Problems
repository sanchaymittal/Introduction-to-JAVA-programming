Java Programs:
Instruction:-
- The code should have proper comments.


Q1: (Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit) Write a program that reads a Celsius degree in a double value from the console, then converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the result. The formula for the conversion is as follows:
fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32

Q2: (Compute the volume of a cylinder) Write a program that reads in the radius and length of a cylinder and computes the area and volume using the following formulas:
area = radius * radius * pi
volume = area * length

Q3. (Financial application: calculate tips) Write a program that reads the subtotal and the gratuity rate, then computes the gratuity and total. For example, if the user enters 10 for subtotal and 15% for gratuity rate, the program displays $1.5 as gratuity and $11.5 as total.

Q4. (Sum the digits in an integer) Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 1000 and adds all the digits in the integer. For example, if an integer is 932, the sum of all its digits is 14.

Hint: Use the % operator to extract digits, and use the / operator to remove the extracted digit. For instance, 932 % 10 = 2 and 932 / 10 = 93

Q5. (Find the number of years) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the minutes (e.g., 1 billion), and displays the number of years and days for the minutes. 
For simplicity, assume a year has 365 days
Q6: (Health application: computing BMI) Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of
health on weight. It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the BMI.
 Note that one pound is 0.45359237 kilograms and one inch is 0.0254 meters.

Q7. (Geometry: distance of two points) Write a program that prompts the user to enter two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays their distance between them.

Q8: (Print a table) Write a program that displays the following table. Cast floating point numbers into integers.
a 		b 		pow(a, b)
1 		2 		1
2 		3 		8
3 		4 		81
4 		5 		1024
5 		6 		15625s


Q9. Write a program to check the given number is palindrome or not?
Descritpion : A Palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. Like 16461, for example: we take 121 and reverse it, after revers it is same as original number
